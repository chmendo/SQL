# In this project, we are analyzing Hacker News Trends which will answer the following questions:
# 1. What is the total score of all stories?
# 2. Which users have scores over 200
# 3. Is the scoreboard dominated by the top users? How much is the percentage of their total scored combined?
# 4. Which user are deliberately rickrolling Hacker News?
# 5. Which websites are the top sources of Hacker News stories?
# 6. What’s the best time of the day to post a story on Hacker News?
